What was most challenging for me during this assignment was figuring out how to properly input the coordinates and length of each side of the shade I wanted to add. It took some trial and error, but I figured out how to properly draw a triangle, circle, ellipse and rectangle. Additionally, I was able to learn how to use the color picker (RGB), to get the right shade of a color. I was a bit confused at first, but with help from my peers, I was able to figure it out and include a lot of different colors in my drawing. I am most proud of the overall finished product, as this is the first drawing that I have created on the p5 editor. I am very exited to see what other drawings I can create.
